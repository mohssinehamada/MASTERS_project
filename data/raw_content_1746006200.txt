This aligns with current national mortgage rate trends. Refinance rates in California While refinance rates are higher than they were a few years ago, it still might make sense to swap your loan if you recently bought a home and rates are now lower. Likewise, if you've owned a home in California for some time and need a significant amount of cash, you might be able to tap your equity with a cash-out refinance . California mortgage rate trends While mortgage rates are hard to predict, local mortgage rates tend to follow the movement of national mortgage rates, which have been rising slightly in recent weeks. Along with rates, home prices in California have been rising, too. The median sale price for a single-family home in the state was up 3.8 percent year-over-year to $852,880 as of November 2024, according to the California Association of Realtors. However, if you’re willing to cast a wider net, you could find significantly lower prices in the far northern reaches of the state, where the median home price was $375,000 — nearly $1 million cheaper than the median home price in the Bay Area. Regardless of where you’re looking, keep in mind real estate prices are often hyper-local. In the Bay Area, for example, San Mateo’s November median sold price of $2.19 million was over three times higher than Solano’s $597,000 median price.

Overnight averages: We calculate daily overnight rate averages on various products from several financial institutions. We collect these APRs after close of business, and they reflect the previous day’s pricing based on a borrower with a 740 FICO credit score and an 80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio buying an existing, single-family primary residence. Bankrate Monitor (BRM) rate averages: On a weekly basis, we also collect APRs from the 10 largest banks and thrifts in 10 of the biggest U.S. markets. For these averages, we assume a borrower with a 700 FICO credit score (740 if a non-conforming loan) and an 80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, among other criteria. The overnight and Bankrate Monitor averages are based on no existing relationship or automatic payments. Learn more about our rate averages , editorial guidelines and how we make money .

Mortgage statistics for California With beaches, mountains and a vibrant economy, California is home to some of the nation’s most expensive housing markets. Affordability is a real challenge here, but over the decades, California homeowners have been rewarded with outsized appreciation. Here are some statistics about mortgages and the housing market in The Golden State: Median single-family home sales price, Nov. 2024: $852,880 Median condo/townhome sales price, Nov. 2024: $675,000 Median days on market, Nov. 2024: 26 Median down payment, Oct. 2024: $158,000 Sources: ATTOM, California Association of Realtors Mortgage options in California California conventional mortgages: Rates and requirements for conventional mortgages will vary depending on the area you want to live in and your financial situation. You can compare mortgage rates to find the option that’s right for you. CalHFA: The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) offers state residents access to mortgages, as well as smaller loans designed to help with down payment or closing costs. To get started, borrowers can contact a CalHFA-approved lender or preferred loan officer . California FHA loans: Home loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) are offered throughout the U.S. While the FHA doesn’t offer loans directly, you can find one through an FHA-approved lender in California. They are offered to first-time homebuyers, defined as those who have not purchased a home in the past two years, as well as repeat buyers. FHA loans are generally designed for low- to moderate-income borrowers with lower credit scores. California VA loans: Guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA loans are offered to eligible veterans and active-duty service members. While the VA doesn’t offer loans directly, you can find one through a VA-approved lender in California. VA loan interest rates are typically lower than conventional mortgages, and these loans require no down payment. California jumbo loans: You’ll find higher conforming loan limits in many of California’s pricier zip codes, but you may still need to borrow even more money to make homeownership a reality in the state. If you do, you’ll need to compare jumbo loan rates from multiple lenders and be prepared to meet higher down payment and credit score requirements. Learn more: Types of home loans First-time homebuyer programs in California Buying a house in California can be pricey, but first-time homebuyers might qualify for grants or other forms of help. This includes: CalHFA down payment assistance programs: Low- to moderate-income borrowers can apply for small down payment and closing costs assistance loans through CalHFA. One option is the MyHome Assistance program, which allows you to borrow a deferred loan worth up to 3.5 percent of the purchase price or appraised value to help you cover closing costs and the down payment. Another option is the California Dream For All Shared Appreciation Loan, which lends qualifying first-generation, first-time buyers up to 20 percent (but not more than $150,000) of the home’s purchase price. The loan must be repaid, along with up to 20 percent of the home’s appreciated value. CalHFA Loan Programs: With the CalHFA Conventional Loan Program , you can get a 30-year fixed-rate conventional loan at potentially a more affordable interest rate, but you’ll also need to meet qualification requirements. The CalPLUS Conventional Loan Program is similar, but with a slightly higher interest rate that can be combined with the CalHFA Zero Interest Program to help pay closing costs. CalHFA also offers lower-interest rate FHA, VA and USDA loans, which come with their own benefits and qualifying criteria. In addition to statewide assistance programs, be sure to compare local options. Some local organizations offer loans and grants to certain types of buyers, including first-time buyers and low- to moderate-income families.
